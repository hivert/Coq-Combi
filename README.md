Contents
========================================================================

* the **Littlewood-Richardson** rule using Schützeberger approach, it includes

  - the *Robinson-Schensted* correspondance

  - the construction of the *plactic monoïd*

  - the *Littlewood-Richardson* and *Pieri* rules using the combinatorial
    (tableau definition of Schur polynomials).

  After A. Lascoux, B. Leclerc and J.-Y. Thibon, "The Plactic Monoid" in
  Lothaire, M. (2011), Algebraic combinatorics on words, Cambridge University
  Press With variant described in G. Duchamp, F. Hivert, and J.-Y. Thibon,
  Noncommutative symmetric functions VI. Free quasi-symmetric functions and
  related algebras. Internat. J. Algebra Comput. 12 (2002), 671–717.

* basic **theory of symmetric functions** including

  - *Schur function* and *Kostka numbers* and the equivalence of the
    combinatorial and algebraic (Jacobi) definition of Schur functions

  - the classical bases, *Newton formulas* and various basis changes

  - the scalar product and the *Cauchy formula*.

* the **character theory of the symmetric Groups**. We do not use
  representations but rather goes as fast as possible to Frobenius
  isomorphism and then uses computations with symmetric polynomials. it includes

  - *cycle types* for permutations (together with Thibaut Benjamin)

  - The tower structure and the *restriction and induction formulas* for class
    indicator (together with Thibaut Benjamin)

  - structure of the *centralizer* of a permutation

  - Young character and *Young Rule*

  - the theory of Frobenius characteristic and *Frobenius character formula*

  - the *Littlewood-Richardson* rule for irreducible character

* the **Hook-Length Formula** for standard Young tableaux
  (together with Christine Paulin and Olivier Stietel). We follow closely

   formula for the number of Young tableaux of a given shape. Adv. in
   Math. 31, 104–109.


* the **Erdös Szekeres theorem** about increassing and decreassing subsequences

* various **Combinatorial objects** including

  - totally and partially ordered types,
  - integer partitions and compositions,
  - tableaux, standard tableaux, skew tableaux,
  - subsequences, integer vectors,
  - standard words and permutations,
  - Yamanouchi words,
  - binary trees

* the **Coxeter presentation of the symmetric group**.

  presentation of the symmetric group generated by elementary transposition

* the **factorization** of the Vandermonde determinant as the product of differences.

* the **Tamari lattice** on binary trees.

Various unstable/unfinished experiments:
========================================

* bijection m-trees <-> m-dyck words.

* a **Why3 certified implementation** of the LR-Rule
  (together with Jean Christophe Filliâtre).

  for the 50th anniversary of the CRM", September 24-28, 2018, Montreal,

Installation
========================================================================

This library is based on

* Coq 8.7 or more recent

* [SSReflect/MathComp]([https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp])
  Library version 1.7.

* Pierre-Yves Strub library for
  [Multinomials] version 1.1 (https://github.com/math-comp/multinomials)


Note: A standalone version of the proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule not
using [Multinomials] is available in the [Legacy
branch](https://github.com/hivert/Coq-Combi/tree/Legacy). It only includes a
bare proof of the LR-rule without formalizing anything on multivariate
polynomials. The proofs given here would be valid for any elements in any
commutative rings.
