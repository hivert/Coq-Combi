(** * The Erdös-Szekeres theorem on monotonic subsequences.

A proof of the Erdös Szekeres theorem about longest increasing and
decreasing subsequences. The theorem is [Erdos_Szekeres] and
says that any sequence [s] of length at least [n*m+1] over a totally ordered
type admit
- either a nondecreasing subsequence of length [n+1];
- or a strictly decreasing subsequence of length [m+1].
We prove it as a corollary of Greene's theorem on the Robinson-Schensted
correspondance. Note that there are other proof which require less theory.
